When reviewing code:

- Do NOT generate pull request overviews.
- Do NOT generate explainers.
- Do NOT summarize what a diff chunk does.
- Only point out issues that are of medium severity or higher.
- Do point out spelling errors in symbol names such as those of variables, classes, methods, and functions.
- Do point out spelling or grammar errors in comments.
- Do point out style issues such as extraneous spaces (for example `a  = b;`).
- Do point out spelling errors in commit messages.
- Do point out issues surrounding C++ `auto` uses. Suggest when `const auto&` can be used, for example.
